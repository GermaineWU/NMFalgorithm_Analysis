# NMFalgorithm_Analysis

## Desciption
The implementation of NMF algorithms and the analysis of their robustness against different types of noise on ORL and YaleB dataset.

## Report 
Experiment results are recorded in "Analysis of the robustness of NMF algorithms.pdf" 

## Run
1. Add dataset "ORL" and "YaleB" to 'data/'.
2. In the Experiment Materials Cell, choose one dataset 'YaleB' or 'ORL', and choose the additive type of noise, including 'Guassian', 'Laplace' and 'Block'.
3. Configure the experiment parameters which can affect experiment results.
4. Open "Experiment_Guide.ipynb" and run all cells.
